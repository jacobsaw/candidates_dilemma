# The Great Debate

### How's it Work?
A moderator (admin) pins candidates (users) against one another in a debate.
Candidates can choose to either stay positive, or attack their opponent.
The number of dedicated voters gained depends on how each candidate acts.

### What's the Deal?
After a series of lengthy conversations about the intersection of politics and game theory,
we decided to create an application that allows normal people to make the same decisions that,
say, presidential candidates make.  Our debate closely resembles the Prisoner's Dilemma:
both candidates have incentives to be negative, but the total benefit (measued by number of voters)
is better if one or both candidates choose to stay positive.
Our goal is to measure how users' decisions change over time.
